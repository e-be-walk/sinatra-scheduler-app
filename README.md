# sinatra-scheduler-app
The Sinatara-Scheduler-App is a Sinatra web application that relies on a databse, AcitveRecord associations, and unique user accounts that allow a user to create, edit, update, and delete appointments and to-dos. We're all busy folks and keeping our tasks organized can be key- the creation of my app hopes to simplifiy these tasks making them easily identified by the user.
